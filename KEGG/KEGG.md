From the KEGG [site](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/): "KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies." The main entry point is [KEGG2](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html) which provides the menu of different categories of information and links to the same. 

Here, I will provide links and usage info from a pathway perspective. I have included two R tutorials that I have developed so far, based on existing tutorials of others (thanks to them!). Tutorial for KEGGREST package that provides client-side support for REST access to KEGG is [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/KEGGREST/man/KEGGREST.pdf). There was some effort involved in installing KEGGREST on my Linux system. KEGGREST installation is detailed in README.md [here](https://github.com/shankar4/Functional-Genomics/edit/master/README.md).
