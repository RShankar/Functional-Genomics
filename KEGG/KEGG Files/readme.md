I donwoladed a few files to understand the formats and to explore ways to automate search and integrate functions. The .xml files are .kgml files that can be opened in a browser. The file 'ko00001.json' is the KEGG Orthology map. Open it in a browser.If you choose the 'raw' option, you will see all of the hierarchies; with the json option, you need to click and keep opening up the lower levels of hierarchies.
