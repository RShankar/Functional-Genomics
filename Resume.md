#### Synergistic (and Large Team) Activities:
* Systems Engineering as pertinent to Precision Medicine (2017-Present):  This will combine advances in engineering and management to provide a cost-effective method to scale up GWAS (Genome Wide Association studies) which hold promise for functional mapping of genome to health and disease. Healthy Aging, one of the four ‘pillars’ (strategic goals) at Florida Atlantic university, provides a framework for our student training and research collaboration across the colleges of engineering, nursing/medicine, and biology.  The initial focus will be on longevity, which has high potential for community participation in S. Florida. 
* Smart Phone, Mobile and Web Applications  (2011 to 2017): Multi-disciplinary efforts that combine my various backgrounds in biomedical, electrical, computer engineering, computer science, innovation, and management. Multi-college joint courses have evolved   on smart phones, robotics and the semantic web. These span high school to graduate school, across a number of colleges. This has facilitated communication across colleges which can be leveraged to evolve a university infrastructure of research enhancement, social entrepreneurism and STEM.
* Engineering Design Productivity (2003-2008): I led groups of 20+ computer science, computer and electrical engineering faculty members and students on a major 6 year Motorola project on radically increasing engineering design productivity. The group changed year-to-year with new goals. This was entitled “One Pass to Production” (OPP) 
* Engineering Design Automnation and VLSI Design (2001-2002): I worked as a senior consultant and technical account manager at Cadence supporting all system and chip design activities at Motorola. This allowed me to meet engineers and managers in all the disciplines and understand their design and product development flow. Citations of the OPP publication are at the CSI site. 
* Early Detection of Atherosclerosis (1991-2001): My biomed patents resulting from pilot studies on human and monkey subjects were licensed to Vasocor Inc. I led a 30+ technical group (5/92-5/93) in developing Vasogram I. Vasogram II was used in a multi-center clinical validation  study. (Herrington et al., [Circulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15262851), 2004).  My noninvasive measure for atherosclerosis was successfully correlated with abdominal aortic measurements with MRI.
