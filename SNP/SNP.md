After reading a paper recently entitled "Variation in FTO contributes to childhoood obesity and severe adult obesity" by Dina et al., 2007, I wished I could find a place with annotated summaries with cross-referencing. **SNPedia** does just that.  Meaning of rs Id from NCBI: A reference SNP ID number, or **“rs” ID**, is an identification tag assigned by NCBI to a group (or cluster) of SNPs that map to an identical location. The rs ID number, or rs tag, is assigned after submission (the db seems mature now; so no new tags). 

For e.g., from the releated page on [rs1121980](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1121980): rs1121980, a SNP in the FTO gene, showed the strongest association of several SNPs in the region with early onset obesity in a study of ~1,000 Caucasians. The odds ratio for the rs1121980(T) risk allele was 1.66 (CI:1.3-2.01); and the odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes (rs1121980(T;T)) were estimated (with a correct p<0.0001) at 1.67 (CI: 1.22-2.27) and 2.76....

Summarized from wiki: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be exonic, intronic, or intergenic. Exoniic SNPs do not necessarily change the amino acid sequence of the protein that is produced, due to degeneracy of the genetic code. Synonymous SNPs do not affect the protein sequence, while nonsynonymous SNPs change the amino acid sequence of protein. The nonsynonymous SNPs are of two types: **missense** (different codon coded) and **nonsense** (a stop codon introduced prematurely).
