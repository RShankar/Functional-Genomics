Notes from "Linux In Action" By D. Clinton, Manning, 2018

Bash is the most popular UNIX shell. A shell interprets user commands, either through a CLI (command line interface) or GUI (graphcial user interface). It is a software layer meant to execute formatted commands using the underlying kernel and HW system resources. *It is the way you talk to your computer*. 

In addition to the older 'more' command, there is a 'less' command now:

>less /etc/services -- scroll up and down through the file with the arrow (I think Home and End keys on my keyboard), PgUp/PgDn, and spacebar keys. Press q to quit
