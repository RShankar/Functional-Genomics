KnitR and Sweave seem to be the two better established tools, based, respectively, on Rmd and LaTeX. I have tried using Sweave on Win7, 
but not successfully as yet. Will try both KnitR and Sweave on my Linux system today. Based on the exchanges on StackOverflow and others,
I have installed knitr and devtools via the Rstudio cran installer. Could not find installr, required for installing sweave on Win. Not 
sure how to install sweave on ubuntu yet. But knitR is installed. Will use it first.
