KnitR and Sweave seem to be the two better established tools, based, respectively, on Rmd and LaTeX. I have tried using Sweave on Win7, 
but not successfully as yet. Will try both KnitR and Sweave on my Linux system today. Based on the exchanges on StackOverflow and others, I have installed knitr, xtable and devtools via the Rstudio cran installer. 

Sweave: See: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr . On RStudio: File | New -> R Sweave gives a basic template. Installation: https://rpubs.com/YaRrr/SweaveIntro . Here is a recent tutorial: 
The installation directions do not give directions for installation of LaTex on Linux. Here is a link for that:http://milq.github.io/install-latex-ubuntu-debian/ .
