It is the large scale study of proteins. My focus here is to learn [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) resources and develop code for accessing the database. KEGGREST r package has been installed for this purpose. Read the primary readme.md file for installation instructions. See the enclosed R code for typical use. There are good online KEGGREST tutorials [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/KEGGREST/inst/doc/KEGGREST-vignette.html) and [here](https://github.com/dgrapov/TeachingDemos/blob/master/Demos/Pathway%20Analysis/KEGG%20Pathway%20Enrichment.Rmd). Some of the required packages/system software had to be installed under sudo. See the main 'readme.md' at this link for more info: https://github.com/shankar4/Functional-Genomics/blob/master/README.md .

For analyzing the DNA sequence downloaded, one will need to use the Biostrings package. For more info/R code, see this [link](https://github.com/shankar4/Functional-Genomics/tree/master/IntroCompGen). Note: A DANStringSet has multiple DNAStrings in the file. This is the default download version from KEGG, even if only one string (or sequence) is downloaded. It is formatted as a list. So, use dnaseq1 <- dnaseq[[1]] to isolate that specific string (in this case, the first one) and use as input to codons function.

Maps are available in KGML format at KEGG [site](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/xml/). Bioconductor has [KEGGraph](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGgraph.html) that can be used to analyze, dissect and visualize these graphs. KEGG has pathway info for Fluid Shear stress and Atherosclerosis [here](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05418+4313). There is a link there for downloading the KGML file (hsa05418). KGML enables automatic drawing of KEGG pathways and provides facilities for computational analysis and modeling of gene/protein networks Action: Open and explore. 

I saw a location with 11 3-D shapes for (I think) MMP - but could not relocate it at the KEGG site. It had link to download Jmol, a Java format for molecular 3-D images. Still not clear what that means. Though I updated java, a certification expiration error popped up when I tried to launch the downloaded Jmol file. Opening it in Chrome showed that it was not an actual 3-D image file, but a reference. Then, I downloaded [Jmol viewer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/postdownload?source=dlp) from sourcforge. Still to understand how to use it.
