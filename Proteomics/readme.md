It is the large scale study of proteins. My focus here is to learn [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) resources and develop code for accessing the database. KEGGREST r package has been installed for this purpose. Read the primary readme.md file for installation instructions. See the enclosed R code for typical use. There are good online KEGGREST tutorials [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/KEGGREST/inst/doc/KEGGREST-vignette.html) and [here](https://github.com/dgrapov/TeachingDemos/blob/master/Demos/Pathway%20Analysis/KEGG%20Pathway%20Enrichment.Rmd). 

For analyzing the DNA sequence downloaded, one will need to use the Biostrings package. For more info/R code, see this [link](https://github.com/shankar4/Functional-Genomics/tree/master/IntroCompGen).
