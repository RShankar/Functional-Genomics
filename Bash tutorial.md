I will try various Bash commands as documented here: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/Bash-Beginners-Guide.html . 
Also install grep ('global regular expression print') with sudo apt-get install grep.
Also, here is a good md tutorial (md is the text editing language used at Github): https://www.markdowntutorial.com/

All the activities below are in a terminal window

#### Find Ubuntu version
$ lsb_release -a

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
Release:	16.04
Codename:	xenial

#### Find various shells on your system
$ cat /etc/shells
##### /etc/shells: valid login shells

/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash

To switch from the default (sh in my case) to bash, execute or enter 'bash' in the terminal window
