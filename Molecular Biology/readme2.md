This is a continuation of readme.md. Mostly notes from "Molecular Biology" 4th ed., by Clark and Russell.
1. Chapter 8 on Gene Transfer in Bacteria - Bacteria divide by binary fission (asexual or vegetative). However, uptake of pure DNA
is possible ('transformation') that can change the properties of the bacterial cell. Transformation is used in genetic engineering.
Most often electroshock treatment is used to push DNA, a huge molecule through the cell walls. DNA uptake may fail (restriction) or 
succeed (recombination). Restriction enzymes chop up the incoming DNA in 'restriction.' The bacteria is permanently changed after 
recombination. If the incoming is part of a plasmid, which replicates on its own, recombination into the chromosome is not needed; 
use of plasmid is preferred. Bacterial geneticists routinely carry out gene transfer by using bacterial viruses, known as bacteriophage
(or phage). 
Example: For *E. Coli*, phages are named PI and Lambda


12.  Glossary (continued): 
* bacteriophase or phage - any virus that infects bacteria
* Plasmid - circular molecule of double helical DNA; replicates independently of the bacterial cell's chromosome. 
* recombination - merging of genes from two separate molecules of DNA
* restriction - destruction of incoming foreign DNA by a bacterial cell
* Transformation - changing the properties of a bacterial cell as a result of uptake of pure DNA
