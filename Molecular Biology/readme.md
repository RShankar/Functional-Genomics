I will document here my notes from "Molecular Biology made simple and fun" by D.P. Clark and L.D. Russell, 2000. Not current, but 
still has much useful info. Outdated:  there is implication that there are 100,000 genes in higher organisms, but the latest estimate: 
19K to 20K protein coding genes in humans. Concepts of Exon and Intron are mentioned, but with more generic terms. 

Prokaryote - Bacterial cells, simplest living cells. Have a single chromosome, and no separate nucleus and cytoplasm as with higher
organisms (Eukaryotes). DNA is inside the nucleus in Eukaryotes. Bacterial cell is 1 micron long and 0.5 micron wide (typ). Bacteria 
have two names, both printed in italics: Genus (a group of closely related species) and species (the individual name). Eg., *E.coli*

Most bacteria are beneficial. Some disease causing ones: Cholera, TB, plague, anthrax, syphillis, Whooping Cough, diptheria, etc. 
Most antibiotics are synthesized by a kind of fungus known as mold. Viruses (bacteriaphages) can infect (and takeover) bacteria. Viruses
are packages of genes in protein coats. They need a living host to multiply. Some human viral diseases: polio, smallpox, herpes, Ebola, and AIDS. 

Genetic terms: Each gene may exist in alternate forms (eg. red or white flowers) - called alleles. Protein is a polymer made from AA (amino acids); they make up most of the structures in the cell and do most of the work. Enzyme is a protein which carries out a chemical reaction.Mutation - is an alteration in the genetic info carried by a gene. wild-type: the original or nautual version of a gene or organism. Null allele: a mutual version of a gene which completely lacks any activity. Outward characteristic - is the phenotype, while the genetic make-up is the genotype. Genes consist of DNA which are arrnged on chromosomes. Bacteria have only one copy of each gene ('haploid'). Higher organisms carry duplicate copies ('diploid'). If more than two copies -- triploid, tetraploid, etc. When two different alleles (Rr) are present, the one that dominates (phenotype-wise) is the dominant allele (the other one - recessive allele). When both alleles are identical - homozygous (RR or rr) ; different - heterozygous (Rr). When two animals or plants reproduce, the mother makes egg cells and the father makes sperm cells. These reproductive cells are germ-line or gametes. Zygote cell formed ty union of sperm and egg developes into a new individual. Somatic cells make up the body. Somatic cells are diploid; egg and sperm cells  are haploid. The Diploid somatic cell undergoes meiosis to give haploid germ cells. Filial generations - successive generations of descendants from a genetic cross (F1, F2, etc). Posession of two X chromosomes makes one  femaie; XY makes a male. A single copy of allele may be partially dominant; two functional alleles may be co-dominant. Genes are linked if on a single copy of a chromosome. Breaking and rejoining of DNA strands may lead to crossing-over. The genetic result of shuffling different alleles: reconbination. The farther apart two genes are on the chromosome, the more likely is a crossover - and higher frequency of recombination. 

Molecular basis of heredity: Genes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Each gene is a linear segment of a long DNA molecule. DNA is a polymer - which is a linear arrangement of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has 3 components: a phosphate group (p) , a sugar (dR), and a nitrogen-containing base. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose. 4 types of bases: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. The bases are joined by Deoxyribose (dR) and stick out sideways. P and dR form the backbone. Nucleotides are joined by linking p on the 5' end of dR1 and 3' end of dR2. The numbering: carbon atoms on a dR are numbered 1' thru 5'. DNA is normally found as a double stranded molecule. Helical arrangement - double helix. A of one strand pairs with t of the other; same with G and C. Each base pair has one double size purine base (A and G - they contain a double ring called puring ring) and a smaller puridine base (C and T). Widths are the same for all. Hydrogen bonds are formed between base pairs. GC have 3 hydrogen bonds (vs 2 of AT) and can withstand higher temperatures. Hydrong bonds are weak; but a DNA molecule has ~Mbp which makes the bond strong. The bonds use nitrogen or oxygen on either side. mRNA (messenger RNA) molecules (short sequences) are formed from the DNA strands and pass through the nuclear membrane pores to the plasma for protein formation. The genes are bound to proteins in the nucleus and together they form the visible material (chromatin). An average bacterial cell is 1 micron long; but the DNA molecule is 1 mm long (1000 times longer). It fits inside the cell coiled (supercoiling). They typically have 50 giant loops of supercoiled DNA arranged around a protein scaffold. 

Duplicating the DNA: replication. Each chromosome must be accurately copied for inheritance. First, both the supercoils and the double helix must be unwound to separate the two strands (by DNA gyrase and DNA helicase, respectively). Single strand binding proteins (SSB) bind to individual strand bases and prevent them from coming together. Each parental strand is a template strand
