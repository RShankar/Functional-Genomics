I will document here my notes from "Molecular Biology made simple and fun" by D.P. Clark and L.D. Russell, 2000. Not current, but 
still has much useful info. Outdated:  there is implication that there are 100,000 genes in higher organisms, but the latest estimate: 
19K to 20K protein coding genes in humans. 

Prokaryote - Bacterial cells, simplest living cells. Have a single chromosome, and no separate nucleus and cytoplasm as with higher
organisms (Eukaryotes). DNA is inside the nucleus in Eukaryotes. Bacterial cell is 1 micron long and 0.5 micron wide (typ). Bacteria 
have two names, both printed in italics: Genus (a group of closely related species) and species (the individual name). Eg., *E.coli*
