readme2.md is continued here. This is essentially summary of certain chapters of Molecular Biology, 4th edition (2010), by Clark and Russelll
1. Genomics and DNA Sequencing, Chapter 23: DNA sequencing involves generating sub-fragments of all possible lengths from the DNA to be 
sequenced. DNA is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Radioactively labeling (**Autoradiography**) is used with gel electrophoresis to separate these segments. 
They are grouped according to which base they end in (4 groups) and run in four parallel lanes. The largest and slowest will be near the 
initial loading end, while the smallest and fastest will be at the other end. Prior to this, the Chain Termination Method is used in the
segmentation (early termination) process (not detailed here). The Oligonucleotide (i.e., short DNA fragment) Array Detector, or the GeneChp, 
is useful both for diagnostic purposes and for large scale DNA sequencing. It uses DNA-DNA hybridization. Synthetic single strand DNA fragments 
on the chip are exposed to denatured (to get single strand) DNA fragment under test. Complementary strands hybridize. Flourescent tagging and 
computer analysis can identify the unknown sequence from the multiple hits, since the synthetic sequences are known and the strength of flourescence. 
The GeneChip will run into trouble if the target DNA contains repeated sequences. GeneChip is used for hereditary defects and forensic analysis.\
2. Molecular Evolution, Chapter 24: 
3. Some relevant information on 'junk DNA': The **Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins, 1976 is a remarkable book that has reached both the 
layperson and the scientist. See Ridley's discussion [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/529462a). He postulated that  the digital 
information in a gene is effectively immortal and must be the primary unit of selection.  No other unit shows such persistence — not 
chromosomes, not individuals, not groups and not species. He also commented that "The true 'purpose' of DNA is to survive, no more and no less. 
The simplest way to explain the surplus DNA is to suppose that it is a parasite.”  The surpluse DNA is also referred to as 'junk DNA.' 
His remark eventually led to the discovery of 'transposons'- much surplus DNA consists of reverse transcriptase — a viral enzyme whose 
job is to spread copies of itself — or simplified versions of transposons dependent on it. Per Wiki, A transposable element (TE or 
transposon) is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome.  Transposition often results in duplication of the same 
genetic material. Barbara McClintock's discovery of these **jumping genes** earned her a Nobel Prize in 1983. In her 1953 work, 
McClintock found that genes could not only move, but they could also be turned on or off due to certain environmental 
conditions or during different stages of cell development. Per Wiki, Class I TEs (retrotransposons) are copied in two stages: first, they are 
transcribed from DNA to RNA, and the RNA produced is then reverse transcribed to DNA. This copied DNA is then inserted back into the 
genome at a new position. The reverse transcription step is catalyzed by a reverse transcriptase, which is often encoded by the TE 
itself. Three types: **long terminal repeats (LTRs), Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and Short interspersed nuclear elements 
(SINEs)**. Per Wiki, the most common transposable element in humans is the Alu sequence. It is approximately 300 bases long and can be 
found 0.5M times in the human genome. Alu alone is estimated to make up 15–17% of the human genome. TEs are mutagens: A functional gene 
after a transposone insertion will likely be disabled; similarly after a transposon leaves a functional gene; and multiple copies, for e.g.,
Alu sequence, can impact precise chromosomal pairing during mitosis and meiosis, resulting in chromosome duplication. Diseases from TEs: 
hemophilia, immunodeficiency, porphyria, predisposition to cancer, and muscular dystrophy. LINE1 (L1) TEs that land on 
the human Factor VIII cause haemophilia and insertion of L1 into the APC gene causes colon cancer, confirming that TEs play an important
role in disease development. Here is the Wiki [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element).
