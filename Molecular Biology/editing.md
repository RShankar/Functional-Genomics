Some odd combination of keys is deleting my added text since the previous save. I think I am choosing 'Select All' and 'Delete' in successive set of keystrokes, because  of the functional attachments to them. First, not sure where those key bindings are made - need to remove them. Second, I want to try them out now, to see the effect. It seems that I am hitting a key near the right side second shortest finger, a key that is next to MS insignia key. 

Here are instructions on disabling a single key:
1. Download MapKeyboard from download.com (27KB only)
2. Uncompress it, then open the MapKeyboard.exe (not installation is required)
A virtual key board will show up.
3. Click on the key that you want to disable. For my case, I click on RAlt to disable right Alt key.
4. Then at "Remap selected key to:", select "Disabled".
5. Finally, click "Save layout" and reboot the PC
If you failed to start the program, you will need to install Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0.

Not sure that is the culprit. i am obviously hitting some odd combinations of keys as I type fast....Need to recreate the sequence...
