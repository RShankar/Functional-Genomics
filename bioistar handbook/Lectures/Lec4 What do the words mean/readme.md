Created JSONTutorial.R based on a tutorial by zev@zevross.com. The author used open portal data from NY city. Used
the author's approach, but made a few changes, as commented in the R file. Included here. 
12/8/17: I will explore SO and GO databases in R with HW 4 problems as the end goal. All of this will be documented 
here.
