SGD data is used to familiarize us with Linux commands. I have done this quiz with both command line tools and RStudio. They are available on my Ubuntu system in the Biostar/lec03 folder, as SGD.r in the SGD folder and Shankar_readme in the Help folder. I tried to 
use script a.txt, where a is the descriptive label; but it was confusing. So, I re-ran the steps and saved only the relevant info in the
file. I am sure there is a good tool for that - still to find that out. 
Not documented these here since this is an on-going course in fall 2017.
