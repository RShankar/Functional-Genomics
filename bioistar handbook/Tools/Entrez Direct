Entrez Direct (EDirect), per Dr. Pevsner, is far easier to use than Entrez Utilities (EUtil), but is command shell based.  EDirect runs 
on Unix and needs Perl installed. I installed Perl module infrastructure from metacpan.org. It is an open source engine for the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). 
Do this: 
sudo apt install cpanminus # it is "is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN and does nothing else."
# It was installed in perl5 folder in my home directory
Cpanm Path::Tiny # this installs Tiny to subfolder Path in perl5
