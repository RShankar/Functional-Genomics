Please see https://www.biostarhandbook.com/. The online version is more up-to-date vs the download (as expected).
They also have a course that you can sign up for a low price and get a a certificate in. There are quizzes to be
completed. 
Three quizzes completed. Read through the section on "reproducibility" and downloaded the papers and files associated with recent
papers on Ebola and Zika viruses. Also downloaded data from GenBank for the first one. The data will be analyzed later with BLAST etc.

Starting work on lecture 4:  "What do words mean." Downloaded HGC data for Chromosome 7 in Json format from here: https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/statistics?c=7. Onto.R will document my work here. 

12/8/17 First, I wanted to understand how to explore nested list structure of JSON files. Installed jsonlite (seems better compared to other packages). Redid a tutorial on the use of R to download and parse JSON data from NY city. Included here as JSONTutorial.R

Getting back to lec 04. Two ontologies are introduced: Sequence Ontology (SO) - defines biological terms; Gene Ontology 
(GO) - defines functional characteristics. Homework (HW04) is to be documented here as a R file (DataMeaning.R). It will use
SO and GO ontologies. First, I will focus on getting to those two through R withe the HW problem as the end goal.
