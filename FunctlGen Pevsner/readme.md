This part is based on "Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics" by J. Pevsner. Dr. Pevsner apparently has his class students at JHU 
discover a gene by the end of the semester. So, we should make that a goal for ourselves too!

Added Biostrings R package from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html) will be added
as per the book (page 11). In the command line, type "R" and enter this at the > prompt: biocLite("Biostrings")
