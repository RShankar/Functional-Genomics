1. Installed Bio-Linux from http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/ . "Bio-Linux 8 adds more than 250 bioinformatics packages to an Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS base, providing around 50 graphical applications and several hundred command line tools. The Galaxy environment for browser-based data analysis and workflow construction is also incorporated in Bio-Linux 8." This required installation of Oracle's VM VirtuaBox from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html . Instructions on the installation of Bio-Linux in VM are here: http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux-installation/ . Notes: Dual-boot was discouraged by our IT experts. An article they referenced: https://www.lifewire.com/run-ubuntu-within-windows-virtualbox-2202098 . I am using Windows 7.
