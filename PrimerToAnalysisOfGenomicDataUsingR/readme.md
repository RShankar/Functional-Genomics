R code from the book as implemented by me on a Ubuntu system is documened here. Should match the book code mostly. Use
Chapter-wise data available at springer.com. The site springerlink.com has a free PDF of the book. See the main readme for more
details. I am documenting the exercises in "Primer to Analysis of Genomic Data Using R" By C. Gondro. The book is free
to download.
